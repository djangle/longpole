# Longpole

[Longpole](https://www.longpole.app/) is an extremely opinionated, abstracted-productivity application designed with small to medium sized field service businesses in mind.

<br />
## Design Principles
* Words Matter! A lot of thought should go into giving names to any element of a system. The vocabulary a system "speaks" can make or break a user's interaction.

* It's (almost) all been done before. Favor best practices over reinventing the wheel.

* Don't sweat the small stuff. Focus on what matters.

* Needs. Never nice to haves.

* Protect the user from themselves.
